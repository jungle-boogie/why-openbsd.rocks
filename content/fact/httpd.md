title: "httpd(8)"
---

OpenBSD had a patched version of Apache httpd imported for a long time. After
that, nginx was used and imported in base, but still the webserver was too
big for the base system.

At some point, Reyk Floeter wrote a minimal HTTP server which replaced all
externally developed http servers in the base system. httpd was first released
in OpenBSD 5.6

```
server "www.example.com" {
	alias "example.com"
	listen on * port 80
	listen on * tls port 443
	root "/htdocs/www.example.com"
}
```
